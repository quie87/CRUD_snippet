### School project that I now have public. Feel free to watch it or even clone it if you like to try it out.

This is a CRUD application

Focus have been on learning Express and some security.
The application handles; Registration, Login, and basic CRUD functions with snippets

### To run the application, Add your own database by inserting a connection-string in the config / mongoose.js file and then run "npm start".
